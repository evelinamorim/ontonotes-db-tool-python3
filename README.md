This repository modified ontonotes-db-tools package to run on python3.

The script compile_coref_data.sh is used to convert the ontonotes v5 dataset to conll dataset. It downloads 
a set of scripts and data from conll-2012. So, you also need to modify to python3 some of these scripts to obtain 
the ontonotes data converted.
